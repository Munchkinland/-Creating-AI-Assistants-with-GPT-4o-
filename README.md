Creating AI Assistants with GPT-4
This project involves creating a GPT-4 file search assistant that summarizes and explains arXiv papers about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The flow of this session is largely taken from the DataCamp OpenAI Assistants API Tutorial and the OpenAI Assistants API documentation.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to leverage GPT-4's capabilities to assist in searching and summarizing arXiv papers related to AGI. This involves setting up an environment to interact with OpenAI's API and utilizing it to extract meaningful insights from scientific papers.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

An OpenAI developer account.
Sufficient credit in your OpenAI developer account.
An environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY containing your API key.
Getting Started
Setup Environment:

Create an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY and set it to your OpenAI API key.

export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the provided Jupyter notebook (Aggie.ipynb) and follow the instructions within to interact with the OpenAI API.
Project Structure
Aggie.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook for the project containing all the code and instructions.

Notes
OpenAI considers much of this code experimental, so expect some changes in the coming months.
